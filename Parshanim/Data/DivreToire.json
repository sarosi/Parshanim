        "textContent": "Tzaddik haya bedorosav. Quesiton: Why do we need to say, bedorosav, everyone is in his generation. Rashi says, there are 2 interpretations: one for praise, one for the opposite. The praise: even in this terrible genration he managed to remain a tzaddik. The opposite: he was a tzaddik only comparing to his terrible generation, but had he lived in Avraham Avinus generation, he would have been a simple person.",

        "textContent": "When Noach was late feeding the lion by 15 minutes, the lion bit him in the leg. Why being 15 minutes late leads to such harsh punishment? Becaue the whole world was in the arch. If Noach was not feeding one of the animals, we would not have that animal now. God's plan to keep the World with the animals he wanted to keep would not succeed. This teaches us that our task is always so important, we are not allowed to take it light, because it is part of God's plan.",
